# BikeRoute


BikeRoute is (or was) a live satnav app for Android, which focused on providing turn-by-turn navigation for cyclists.

Makes use of the CycleStreets, MapQuest, and Google directions APIs.

BikeRoute was available on the Google Play app store until a few years ago, when I took it down because I no longer had time to support it properly. Happily, the turn-by-turn navigation situation for bikes has improved a lot since then!

Feel free to make use of the code.
